# je-color-matrix
A WordPress plug-in that works with the GeneratePress theme to display global color variables defined in the Color section of the customizer.
# What the project does
It displays the color variables defined in the Customizer. The display is in a matrix fashion to give a visual sense of how they work together. Included is a toggle to display values for Accessbility.
# Why the project is useful
When rebranding or rebuilding a website new colors are often chosen by a designer or the client. By displaying the colors and accessibility score in a matrix form, it gives a visual sense to their compatibility BEFORE a lot of work on the website is performed and potentially wasted as clients change their minds. It also provides a way of verifying the global values. The default color variables from GeneratePress include base value, contrast, and accent colors.

Typically this is used during the early stages of a website build. The plug-in should be removed when the final site is delivered. It doesn't hurt to leave it in, but it isn't necessary.
# How to use
1. Define the colors in GeneratePress customizer (Customizer -> Colors)
2. Install the plug-in using the normal methods.
3. Create a temporary page under any name. On the page define the shortcode [/colour_matrix]
4. View the page

That's it!
